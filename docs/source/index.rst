Welcome!
===================================

**proj-gw-likelihood** is a Python library designed to compute the agreement of an astrophysical model with gravitational-wave observations.
It pulls data from the `LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration and KAGRA Collaboration Data Releases <https://zenodo.org/communities/ligo-virgo-kagra?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
